                <span class="p">
                    <strong>Where is the store based?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    This store is based in Everett, Washington, in the United States and is managed by <a href="https://www.whitesquirrel.com/">White Squirrel</a>
                    !
                </span>
                <span class="p">
                    When I receive merch from manufacturers, I get it delivered to my house, quality check it, and individually wrap each item if needed and I send it to <a href="https://www.whitesquirrel.com/">White Squirrel</a>
                    . They do things like shipping out individual orders and customer service because unfortunately I work a full time job and don &#39;t have enough time to do those things!
                </span>
                <span class="p">
                    <strong>What is this store &#39;s return and exchange policy?</strong>
                    <br/>If the item you purchased arrives broken or damaged we will replace it, just contact our store &#39;s support email through the contact form.
                </span>
                <span class="p">
                    <strong>What if something is wrong with my order?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    Please contact the store directly through the contact page or White Squirrel at <a href="mailto:Help@WhiteSquirrel.com">Help@WhiteSquirrel.com</a>
                    .
                </span>
                <span class="p">
                    <strong>Do you accept orders placed outside of the US?</strong>
                    <br/>Yes we do! Please be advised that shipping costs are considerably higher, and unfortunately that is beyond our control.
                </span>
                <span class="p">
                    <strong>Do I have to pay duty or import charges?</strong>
                    <br/>All orders placed by customers outside the USA may have to pay additional fees when your order is imported into your country. This is the responsibility of you, the customer, not the artist nor fulfillment company.
                </span>
                <span class="p">
                    <strong>Do I have to pay VAT (Value Added Tax) if I live in the EU?</strong>
                    <br/>Yes, you may have to pay additional taxes to receive packages from customs officials, similar to duty and import fees. Please note that the customer is responsible for all VAT and that is not something that the seller is responsible for.
                </span>
                <span class="p">If you are located within the United Kingdom, you will have to pay VAT at the time of purchase.</span>
                <span class="p">If you are located within the European Union, you may have to pay VAT at the time of importation, as determined by your local customs authority. By placing an order on this store, you agree that you are responsible for these charges.</span>
                <span class="p">
                    <strong>How do you calculate shipping costs?</strong>
                    <br/>We ship through the United States Postal Service, UPS, and DHL Express. Shipping costs are calculated automatically based on the weight and size of the package, and the destination.
                </span>
                <span class="p">International shipping estimates can be exceptionally high, so if you are charged a higher rate than the actual cost, we will let you know.</span>
                <span class="p">International shipments may incur customs charges from your home country, we are not responsible for the payment of these charges.</span>
                <span class="p">
                    <strong>How long will it take to receive my order?</strong>
                    <br/>Our goal is to ship your order to you within a week of when you placed it. Sometimes, like when we launch a new product, or open the store, we get a higher than usual volume of orders. We &#39;re working as fast as we can to get the shipments out, and we appreciate your patience.
                </span>
                <span class="p">All orders will be sent with tracking numbers, and you should receive an email from Shopify with that info as soon as your item ships.</span>
                <span class="p">Once shipped most domestic orders take anywhere from 2 to 10 business days to arrive depending on the efficiency of your local postal service. International shipping delivery times may vary between 2 and 12 weeks.</span>
                <span class="p">
                    <strong>Do you offer any freebies?</strong>
                    <br/>You will get a few stickers with each purchases as long as supplies last (they &#39;re stickers I salvaged from a terribly misprinted batch)! They &#39;re the same design as the ones in the store, but they are cut differently and are printed on different material and are also smaller! I hope you like them :)
                </span>
                <span class="p">
                    <strong>I &#39;m not out and would like to hide the fact that I bought something from your store. Could you please hide the name of the manga on the package?</strong>
                    <br/>We don &#39;t include any invoices or packing slips within the actual packages, and the shipping label only shows the White Squirrel logo, and sometimes the name of the shop. The title of the manga won &#39;t appear anywhere so no worries!
